ðŸ“„ Quotation Assistant App
Quotation Assistant is a sales support application designed to streamline and speed up the quotation creation process. By leveraging past quotation history, the app allows sales teams to quickly generate new quotations using a predefined Excel template and export them as PDF files â€” saving time and minimizing manual errors.

ðŸš€ Current Features

Create Excel files using a customizable quotation template.

Export final quotations as professionally formatted PDF documents.

ðŸŒŸ Future Vision
In future versions, the app will integrate AI to make the quotation process even smarter. Salespeople will be able to:

Automatically receive accurate product suggestions and matching quotation details â€” even without knowing the exact model name.

This will significantly reduce the effort required to create accurate quotations, especially for complex product catalogs.
